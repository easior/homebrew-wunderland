Homebrew Wunderland
==============

Introduction
--------------

This is a homebrew tap of mine. There contain homebrew Formulae frequently used
by me in this tap. Some of them come from the internet with minor modifications.
The remnants of them are written by me. Anyone, who wants any part of them, could
feel free to use them with his/her own taste.

Installation
--------------

Before using this homebrew tap, it is necessary to install official homebrew (cf.
https://brew.sh). Once the homebrew is installed, just open your favouriate
terminal (e.g. iTerm2 etc.), and execute the following command:
```sh
$ brew tap easior/wunderland
```

Enjoy yourself!
